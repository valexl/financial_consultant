# Spendings subdomain

In the beginning of each month I create info about this month. It conains info about expected living expenses, untility costs, mortgage and credit payments, rent payments, some big purchases. Every single day I track spendings heppenind during this day. They can be either what was already planned (like mortage payment) or some living expenses (like food or cinema) or something unpredictable (like broken washing machine) or something that you planned many many days ago - trip to another country. Some of purchases can be canceled.
